**Next.js** offers a powerful and simple routing system that lets you create pages by just creating files in the **pages** directory. This file-based routing makes it easy to add new pages without any need for configuration files or complex setups.

### Static Routing

Each file you create in the **pages** directory becomes a route automatically. For example:

- **/index.js** → **/** (Homepage)
- **/about.js** → **/about**

Static routing in Next.js is very simple. Every file becomes a new page, meaning there is no need for a routing configuration. The filenames represent the routes.

### Dynamic Routing

For **dynamic routes**, Next.js allows you to define URL parameters by using square brackets (`[param]`). For example:

```jsx
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

const Post = () => {
  const { id } = useRouter().query;
  return <div>Post ID: {id}</div>;
};

export default Post;
```

In the example above, the `[id].js` file matches routes like `/post/1` or `/post/hello`. The dynamic part, `id`, can be accessed using the `useRouter()` hook provided by Next.js.

### Nested Dynamic Routes

Next.js also supports **nested dynamic routes**. You can structure your folders to reflect more complex routing patterns. For instance:

```bash
/pages
  └── /blog
        ├── [category]
              └── [post].js 
```

This setup will match URLs such as:

- `/blog/technology/nextjs-intro`
- `/blog/design/ui-ux-trends`

In your `post.js` file, you can access both the `category` and `post` parameters like this:

```jsx
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

const Post = () => {
  const { category, post } = useRouter().query;
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{post}</h1>
      <p>Category: {category}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Post;
```

### Fallback Pages

When you're using Static Generation (SSG), sometimes not all paths are known at build time. In such cases, Next.js provides a feature called **fallback**. This allows you to dynamically generate pages on the first request and cache them for future requests.

Here’s how you enable fallback in a dynamic route:

```jsx
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  return {
    paths: [],
    fallback: true,
  };
}

export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  const post = await fetchPost(params.id);
  return {
    props: { post },
  };
}
```

When a user visits a path that hasn’t been pre-rendered, Next.js will display a fallback version of the page while it’s being generated. Once generated, it will be cached and served as a static page for future requests.

### Pre-rendering Methods: SSG vs. SSR

Next.js provides two pre-rendering methods:

- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pages are generated at build time and served as static HTML. This is the default method for Next.js, providing excellent performance as the content is generated ahead of time.
- **Server-side Rendering (SSR)**: Pages are generated on each request. This is useful for content that changes frequently or requires up-to-date data at the time of the request.

```jsx
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const data = await res.json();

  return {
    props: { data },
  };
}
```

Use SSG for content that doesn't change often, like blogs or marketing pages. Use SSR when your content changes frequently, like dashboards or user-specific pages.

### API Routes

Next.js also provides a powerful way to create API routes directly within your application. You can create API endpoints by adding files to the **pages/api** directory:

```jsx
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello, World!' });
}
```

These API routes are server-side only, meaning they don’t increase the client-side JavaScript bundle size. API routes are perfect for building custom backends or proxying requests.

### Link Component

To enable client-side navigation between routes, Next.js provides a **Link** component. This improves performance by preventing full-page reloads:

```jsx
import Link from 'next/link';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to Next.js Routing!</h1>
      <Link href="/about">
        <a>Go to About Page</a>
      </Link>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The Link component uses the `href` attribute to define the route and wraps the anchor tag `<a>` to enable seamless navigation within your app.

### SEO Benefits

Next.js routing is not only simple but also **SEO-friendly**. By generating static pages and creating clean URL structures, Next.js helps improve your website’s visibility on search engines.

In conclusion, Next.js simplifies routing by allowing you to create routes directly from file names and folder structures. The built-in support for static and dynamic routes, along with powerful API routing and SEO benefits, makes Next.js an excellent choice for building modern web applications.
