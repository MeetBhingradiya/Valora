**React hooks** are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. Hooks simplify the way we handle state, side effects, and other functionalities, making functional components more powerful.
        
### **1. useState**
The **useState** hook allows you to add state to functional components. It returns a state variable and a function to update it.
```jsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```
- **count**: The current value of the state.
- **setCount**: A function to update the value of \`count\`.

This hook is ideal when managing values like **form inputs**, **counters**, or any data that can change.

### **2. useEffect**
The **useEffect** hook lets you perform side effects in functional components, such as:
- Fetching data from an API.
- Manually changing the **DOM**.
- Setting up subscriptions.

It runs **after the first render** and after every update, by default.
```jsx
useEffect(() => {
    // Code to run after the component renders or updates
}, []);
```
- The **dependency array** controls when the side effect is executed.
- Passing an empty array **(\`[]\`)** means it runs only after the initial render.

Hooks like **useState** and **useEffect** help bring simplicity and flexibility to your code, replacing the need for class components in many situations.

### **Benefits of Using Hooks**
- **Simplifies State Management**: You can add and manage component state with **less boilerplate**.
- **Code Reusability**: Extract reusable **logic** into custom hooks.
- **Functional Components**: All components can be functional, which simplifies the component structure.

React hooks have become an essential part of the React ecosystem, providing developers with **easier**, **more readable**, and **more maintainable** code.
